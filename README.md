## The Problem
Write a function that will take a string with 1-4 characters, ASCII encode them, pad the result to 4 bytes, and then scrambles the resulting bits in the following format. You may not treat any of the binary numbers as strings. The encoding is as follows:

A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X Y-X-A-B-C-D-E-F

A-I-Q-Y-B-J-R-Z C-K-S-A-D-L-T-B E-M-U-C-F-N-V-D G-O-W-E-H-P-X-F
